# Suggested Solutions

This folder contains *suggested* solutions for the OpenHack challenges. These are not definitively "correct" answers, but primarily serve to:

* Validate that the challenges can be solved using all of the available technology options.
* Provide additional support to coaches.

These solutions should ***not*** be shared with OpenHack participants, even after the OpenHack event has finished.
